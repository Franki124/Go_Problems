<p>Emma has just finished learning about defer statements! She has created a Go program that has both deferred functions and deferred <code class="language-go">fmt.Println()</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func foo() {
    fmt.Println("4️⃣")
    defer fmt.Println("5️⃣")
}

func bar() {
    defer fmt.Println("2️⃣")
    fmt.Println("3️⃣")
}

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("1️⃣")
    defer bar()
    foo()
}</code></pre>
<p>Emma is challenging her friends to guess the correct order in which they'll be printed!</p>
<p>Please list the output of the <code class="language-go">fmt.Println()</code> statements below in the correct order they will be printed.</p>
